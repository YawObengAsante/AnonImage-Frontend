              We're a completely faceless, nameless, and identity-less group of internet dwellers who somehow thought the world needed yet another place to share images anonymously. Because clearly, the internet wasn't mysterious enough already.

            <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Our team consists of exactly zero people who will admit to working on this project, which makes company retreats wonderfully inexpensive (and nonexistent).

              We may or may not exist in several countries simultaneously, or possibly in none at all. The beauty of anonymity is that we can claim whatever we want with absolutely no proof whatsoever.

              We're committed to providing a platform where you can share whatever images your heart desires, as long as it's legal (and sometimes even when it's questionably legal, but let's not dwell on that).
